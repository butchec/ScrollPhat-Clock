# ScrollPhat-Clock
24hr Clock on a Pimoroni ScrollPhat

I was playing around with the default library for numbers and letters, and I wondered if I could fit four digits instead of the default three digits on the LED Matrix.

Based on my experience with the SenseHat I created a number library (see numbers.py) and by adding a time section I was able to setup a 24 hour clock fairly quickly.

The last addon was to create a flashing part to simulate the seconds.

Have a play and let me know if you have any other suggestions for the four digit display.
